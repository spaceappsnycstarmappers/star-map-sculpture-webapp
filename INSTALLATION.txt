These should be installed:
  python 2.7
  (if you don't have "pip", you mean need to install it)
  virtualenv

Getting setup:
  cd sculpture-webapp
  virtualenv venv --distribute
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install Flask gunicorn

Running webapp locally:
  (while in the sculpture-webapp directory)
  source venv/bin/activate
  python sculpture.py
  (and go to the URL they output!)
